# The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

# What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
